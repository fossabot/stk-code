# Online networking games for STK

## Hosting server
### Hosting WAN (public internet) server
You are required to have an stk online account first, go [here](https://addons.supertuxkart.net/register.php) for registration.

It is recommended you have a saved user in your computer to allow hosting multiple servers simultaneously with the same account, if you have a fresh STK installation, first run:

`supertuxkart --init-user --login=your_registered_name --password=your_password`

After that you should see `Done saving user, leaving` in terminal if it successfully logged in.

Than you can just run:

`supertuxkart --server-config=your_config.xml --network-console`

It will create that xml configuration file if not found in current directory, you can type `quit` in terminal, than you can edit that file for further configuration as required.

The current server configuration xml looks like this:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<server-config version="1" >

    <!-- Name of server, encode in XML if you want to use unicode characters. -->
    <server-name value="stk server" />

    <!-- Port used in server, if you specify 0, it will use the server port specified in stk_config.xml or if random-server-port is enabled in user config, than any port. STK will auto change to random port if the port you specify failed to be bound. -->
    <server-port value="0" />

    <!-- Game mode in server, 0 is normal race (grand prix), 1 is time trial (grand prix), 3 is normal race, 4 time trial, 6 is soccer, 7 is free-for-all and 8 is capture the flag. Notice: grand prix server doesn't allow for players to join and wait for ongoing game. -->

    <validation-timeout value="20" />

    <!-- By default WAN server will always validate player and LAN will not, disable it to allow non-validated player in WAN. -->
    <validating-player value="true" />

    <firewalled-server value="true" />

    <!-- No server owner in lobby which can control the starting of game or kick any players. -->
    <owner-less value="false" />

    <!-- Time to wait before entering kart selection screen if satisfied start-game-threshold below for owner less or ranked server. -->
    <start-game-counter value="30" />

    <!-- Only auto start kart selection when number of connected player is larger than max player * this value, for owner less or ranked server, after start-game-counter. -->
    <start-game-threshold value="0.5" />

    <!-- Automatically end linear race game after 1st player finished for some time (currently his finished time * 0.25 + 15.0). -->
    <auto-end value="false" />

    <!-- Enable team choosing in lobby in team game (soccer and CTF). If owner-less is enabled, than this option is always disabled. -->
    <team-choosing value="true" />

    <!-- Server will submit ranking to stk addons server for linear race games, you require permission for that. validating-player, auto-end and owner-less will be turned on. -->
    <ranked value="false" />

    <flag-return-timemout value="20" />

    <!-- Value used to calculate hit limit in free for all, which is min(number of players * hit-limit-threshold, 40), negative value to disable hit limit. -->
    <hit-limit-threshold value="5" />

    <!-- Value used to calculate time limit in free for all, which is max(number of players * time-limit-threshold-ffa, 3.0) * 60, negative value to disable time limit. -->

    <!-- Value used to calculate capture limit in CTF, which is max(3.0, number of players * capture-limit-threshold), negative value to disable capture limit. -->
    <capture-limit-threshold value="0.7" />

    <!-- Value used to calculate time limit in CTF, which is max(3.0, number of players * (time-limit-threshold-ctf + flag-return-timemout / 60.0)) * 60.0, negative value to disable time limit. -->
    <time-limit-threshold-ctf value="0.9" />

    <!-- Value used by server to automatically calculate lap of each race in network game, if more than 0.0f, the number of lap of each track vote in linear race will be determined by max(1.0f, auto-lap-ratio * default lap of that track). -->
    <auto-lap-ratio value="-1" />

    <max-ping value="300" />

    <kick-high-ping-players value="false" />

    <!-- ip: IP in X.X.X.X/Y (CIDR) format for banning, use Y of 32 for a specific ip, expired-time: unix timestamp to expire, if -1 (uint32_t max) than a permanent ban. -->
    <server-ip-ban-list>
        <ban ip="0.0.0.0/0" expired-time="0"/>

    <server-online-id-ban-list>
        <ban online-id="0" expired-time="0"/>
    </server-online-id-ban-list>

</server-config>

```

At the moment STK has a list of STUN servers for NAT penetration which allows players or servers behind a firewall or router to make connectable to each other, but in case it doesn't work, you have to manually disable firewall / do a port-forward for the server port STK using.
By default STK uses `2759` for server port, for example in Ubuntu alike Linux distribution do the following to disable firewall on such port:

`sudo ufw allow 2759`

You may also need to handle the server discovery port `2757` for connecting your WAN server in LAN / localhost.

Notice: You don't need to make any firewall or router configuration if you connect to our official servers.

### Hosting LAN (local internet) server
Everything is basically the same as WAN one, except you don't need an stk online account, just do:

`supertuxkart --server-config=your_config.xml --lan-server=your_server_name --network-console`

In LAN network it is required that the server and server discovery port is connectable by clients directly, no NAT penetration will be done in LAN.

------
After the first time configuration, you can just start the server with the command:

`supertuxkart --server-config=your_config.xml`, regardless of whether LAN or WAN server is chosen (of course you need to have a saved user for the WAN one), by default your server logging will be saved to the STK configuration directory with a name of `your_config.log`, given that the server configuration filename is `your_config.xml`.

You can find out that directory location [here (See Where is the configuration stored?)](https://supertuxkart.net/FAQ)
